Installing BirdEye Python
=========================

BirdEye Python supports Python 3.9+. The recommended way to install is via
``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install birdeye-py

.. note::

    Depending on your system, you may need to use ``pip3`` to install packages for
    Python 3.

Or with ``uv``:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv add birdeye-py

.. warning::

    Avoid using ``sudo`` to install packages. Do you `really` trust this package?
